        <h2>Expose and focus first, then frame your shot</h2>
        An improperly exposed or blurry picture is unusable, but one not
        precisely framed may still be saved. For this reason, you should always
        focus on and properly expose for the subject before adjusting the frame.
        This is something that happens more often when you have extreme lights
        and darks in the same scene.

        <h2>Focus on the eyes</h2>
        We are always drawn towards the eyes in a photograph, since eyes are a
        natural focal point that we connect with. When taking portrait
        photographs at any aperture, make sure you nail the focus on the eyes.
        As long as the eyes are in focus, both you and your subject are more
        likely to consider the picture to be properly shot.

        <h2>Straighten and crop when editing</h2>
        You should try to straighten shots by looking through your camera’s
        viewfinder before capturing an image, but it’s not always easy to get
        this perfect on the first try. The viewfinder or the preview on your LCD
        is quite small compared to full-screen editing so you may realize it
        needs adjusting once you see it on a bigger screen. Simply rotate your
        images in post production software and crop out the empty spaces.
      </p>

        <h2>Make use of reflections</h2>
        There are lots of unique opportunities if you pay attention where most
        people don’t. One of the things to look out for are reflections. You can
        find them after (or even during) rainy days, in puddles, in lakes and
        even in swimming pools. Water isn’t the only source, try mirrors, big
        glass windows, and chromed out fixtures.
